# EyeBreak
The EyeBreak Chrome Extension is a tool designed to help users reduce eye strain and improve their overall well-being by reminding them to take regular breaks from their computer screen. 

EyeBreak reminds users to practice the optometrist recommended 20-20-20 rule which suggests to focus your eyes on something at least 20 feet away, for a total of 20 seconds, for every 20 minutes spent using a screen.

The extension allows users to set a timer for 20 minutes, after which a notification will remind them to take a break. The timer will repeat every 20 minutes with a 20-second break before the next alarm starting for 20 minutes.

This rule is essential for everyone today, as almost everyone uses a computer screen everyday. Following this rule would mean less eye strain, better eyesight and less headaches.
